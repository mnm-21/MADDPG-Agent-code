# MADDPG Python Implementation

Minimal PyTorch implementation of OpenAI's Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

## Key Features
- Decentralized agents with centralized critics
- Experience replay buffer for multi-agent training
- Compatible with OpenAI Gym environments
- Simplified PyTorch implementation
